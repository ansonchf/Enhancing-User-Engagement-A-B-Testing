# Onboarding Process A/B Test Analysis

## Background:

The Company Product team aimed to enhance user engagement with the onboarding process to increase the proportion of registered users who search for venues and send enquiries. This analysis focuses on assessing the impact of A/B test variants on user behavior.

## Goal:

The objective was to increase the proportion of registered users who search for venues and send enquiries. Test variants included hiding the option of choosing "Undecided" on the location step of onboarding (Variant 1) and simplifying the text around the counts of venues in the location on the call-to-action (CTA) screen (Variant 2).

## Contributions ðŸ’ª

- **Data Analysis**: Conducted in-depth analysis of the A/B test data to uncover insights into user behavior and the impact of test variants.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Provided actionable recommendations to the Product team based on the analysis findings to improve user engagement and achieve business objectives.
- **Communication Skills**: Effectively communicated complex technical findings in a clear and understandable manner to non-technical stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making.

## Action Plan:

1. **Data Exploration**: Investigate the AB test data to understand user behavior and identify patterns.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Explore relationships between different variables to uncover insights.
3. **Variant Comparison**:
    - Compare user actions between different variants to understand the impact of changes.
    - Analyze metrics such as adding location, clicking on search, and sending enquiries.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**: Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations to improve user engagement based on the test results.
5. **Communication with Stakeholders**: Present findings and recommendations to the Product team in an accessible and understandable manner.

## Insights ðŸ’¡:

- Variant 1, which hid the option to choose "Undecided" on the location step, showed a significant increase in users adding a location compared to the control group.
- Variant 2, which simplified the call-to-action text, also led to a notable increase in users adding a location and clicking on the search button.
- No significant differences were observed in other metrics between the variants.

## Summary:

The A/B test provided valuable insights into improving user engagement with the onboarding process. By implementing changes similar to those in Variant 1 and Variant 2, the company can potentially increase the number of users taking actions such as adding a location and searching for venues. Further analysis and communication with stakeholders will help refine strategies for enhancing user experience and achieving business goals.
